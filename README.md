# DelightfulDeli

Group project for Java Programming at Tacoma Community College, Winter 2021.

I led the project, defined the class structure, and compiled everyone's code. We hadn't learned about versioning/git yet so mostly swapping .txt documents and, ultimately, posting to a shared oneDrive folder.

Simple terminal based text game simulating a local deli, taking order for your sandwich then "rating" the quality, assigning a score at the end of sandwich making.
